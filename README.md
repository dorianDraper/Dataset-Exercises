## Real State Data Cleanup
This is a real dataset and it was downloaded using web scraping techniques. The data contains registers from fotocasa which is one of the most popular websites of real estate in Spain. 

The dataset was downloaded a few years ago by Henry Navarro and In no case were economic returns obtained from it. 

It contains thousands of data from real houses published on the web www.fotocasa.com. Your goal is to extract as much information as possible with the knowledge you have so far about data science, for example what is the most expensive house in the entire dataset?
